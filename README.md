These are example projects to highlight some of my coding experience:

1.    Habits_api_call.py > This is a script that gets data from a Habit tracking app (called "Habitica") via an API call. This data is stored in an SSMS database, and then tracks the rolling average completion rate for each habit over the past week before emailing me a line graph as  a quick visualisation. [Demonstrated Skills: Python, SQL, API Calls]
